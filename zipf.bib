abstract = {{Subtitled "An introduction to human ecology," this work attempts systematically to treat "least effort" (and its derivatives) as the principle underlying a multiplicity of individual and collective behaviors, variously but regularly distributed. The general orientation is quantitative, and the principle is widely interpreted and applied. After a brief elaboration of principles and a brief summary of pertinent studies (mostly in psychology), Part One (Language and the structure of the personality) develops 8 chapters on its theme, ranging from regularities within language per se to material on individual psychology. Part Two (Human relations: a case of intraspecies balance) contains chapters on "The economy of geography," "Intranational and international cooperation and conflict," "The distribution of economic power and social status," and "Prestige values and cultural vogues"â€”all developed in terms of the central theme. 20 pages of references with some annotation, keyed to the index.

abstract = {{Zipf's law states that the frequency of word tokens in a large corpus of natural language is inversely proportional to the rank. The law is investigated for two languages English and Mandarin and for n-gram word phrases as well as for single words. The law for single words is shown to be valid only for high frequency words. However, when single word and n-gram phrases are combined together in one list and put in order of frequency the combined list follows Zipf's law accurately for all words and phrases, down to the lowest frequencies in both languages. The Zipf curves for the two languages are then almost identical.}},

abstract = {{Zipf's law is just one out of many universal laws proposed to describe statistical regularities in language. Here we review and critically discuss how these laws can be statistically interpreted, fitted, and tested (falsified). The modern availability of large databases of written text allows for tests with an unprecedent statistical accuracy and also a characterization of the fluctuations around the typical behavior. We find that fluctuations are usually much larger than expected based on simplifying statistical assumptions (e.g., independence and lack of correlations between observations).These simplifications appear also in usual statistical tests so that the large fluctuations can be erroneously interpreted as a falsification of the law. Instead, here we argue that linguistic laws are only meaningful (falsifiable) if accompanied by a model for which the fluctuations can be computed (e.g., a generative model of the text). The large fluctuations we report show that the constraints imposed by linguistic laws on the creativity process of text generation are not as tight as one could expect.}},
