Is LDA consistent? When correctly specified, does it converge to the true model as sample size (and perhaps iterations of the gibbs sampler) increase?

What is the effect of misspecifying k? Too big? Too small? POsterior contraction analysis paper may be of use here

What is effect of misspecifying alpha? Magnitude too big/small. Shape wrong.
What is the effect of misspecifying eta? Same deal but also non-zipfian vs. zipfian.

What is the effect of corpus composition? Number of documents, number of tokens, document lengths and distributions thereof.

Does LDA have the properties under 3.1 Aims of Morris et al. 2019?
- consistency of estimator to estimand?
- consistent estimate of variance of estimand?
- CIs have property of 100(1 - a)% contain estimand? - Do I even care b/c Bayesian?
- Is LDA efficient estimator?
- B/C LDA generates the data, would these even matter?

Need experimental design. "Factorial Design"
- Over corpus characteristics in demonstrating that simulations can get close to human language
- Over LDA hyperparameters and plausible ranges they can take on, this includes also document lengths and their distributions, and vocabulary sizes (seen and unseen in a given sample)

To the second point, get an estimate of plausible ranges based on points on pareto frontier of SigOpt
